# Import time entries into  [Productive](https://developer.productive.io/) via PDF, CSF or JSON files

*Since there are no breaks in productive, the come and go times are not imported by default. Just the total working hours per day are stored.*


## üí° Requirements
- Node.js 18 (works also with 16+, but slower, and experimental hints)
- Git


## üöÄ Setup

- Choose compatible node version `nvm use`
- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Export time entries from third-party systems and save them in the `./time-entries` directory (PDF, CSV or JSON allowed)
- Copy the `.env-sample` as `.env` file and enter your data
- Compile, convert and import data into productive with `npm start` or do it manually step by step
  * `npm run compile`
  * `npm run convert`
  * `npm run import`

### Your PDF to CSV Task is not working?

In principle, this can have many causes. Sometimes the PDF version is outdated, encrypted, or the PDF is an unsupported XFA-PDF.

Firefox PDF Reader can open these PDF files. The "print and save as PDF" trick can be used to save outdated or broken PDF as compatible PDF.

Otherwise, the [PDF reader](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/web/viewer.html) can also be used directly as an online tool in Google Chrome.

### Your CSV to JSON Task is not working?

Below is an example of a compatible CSV file:
